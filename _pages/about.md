Relying on this project to complete the undergraduate graduation design “structured light-based integrated casting surface defect detection system design”, I joined the Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education of the Earth Information Exploration Instrumentation, selected the appropriate structured light equipment, calculated the casting surface of the three-dimensional point cloud, and selected the appropriate stitching method to multiple local scanning of the point cloud data into a complete three-dimensional model, and then based on the surface shape anomaly design feature extraction method to distinguish between normal and defective areas. Then we design a feature extraction method based on surface shape anomalies to distinguish between normal and defective areas. Finally, for multiple batches of real integrated casting samples, the defect detection algorithm is utilized to detect the 3D point cloud on the casting surface for algorithm validation and performance evaluation.

The sex ratio of sea lampreys varies with environmental changes. To investigate its impact, we first established the relationship between food supply, growth rate, and sex ratio based on the logistic function, and improved the Lotka Volterra predator model to analyze the changes in the number of various groups when the sex ratio changes. At the same time, the coefficient of variation was introduced into the multi-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model to objectively calculate weights and perform fuzzy evaluation calculations on the entire hierarchical structure constructed. Finally, a cellular automaton model was established to simulate the changes in sex ratio of the lamprey population and its spatiotemporal evolution process on the ecosystem. The adjustment mechanism of sex ratio was explored through iterative update rules.

Relying on this project and the Jilin Higher Education Society's Higher Education Research Project “Research on the Construction of Innovative Research University Physics Experiment First-class Curriculum System in the Context of the New Era”, we made a thermal radiation experimental apparatus that can eliminate the influence of thermal convection by controlling the thermal convection in the process of heat transfer. We used the apparatus to study the influence of thermal radiation by the object's material, color, distance, roughness and other factors, and quantified the radiation absorption capacity of different materials through the calculation of blackness.
