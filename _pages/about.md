The sex ratio of sea lampreys varies with environmental changes. To investigate its impact, we first established the relationship between food supply, growth rate, and sex ratio based on the logistic function, and improved the Lotka Volterra predator model to analyze the changes in the number of various groups when the sex ratio changes. At the same time, the coefficient of variation was introduced into the multi-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model to objectively calculate weights and perform fuzzy evaluation calculations on the entire hierarchical structure constructed. Finally, a cellular automaton model was established to simulate the changes in sex ratio of the lamprey population and its spatiotemporal evolution process on the ecosystem. The adjustment mechanism of sex ratio was explored through iterative update rules.

Based on the collected magnetic resonance signals, Hilbert transform is applied for linearization processing. MATLAB is used to write a program for least squares fitting, and multiple criteria are combined to remove spike noise. Then, harmonic modeling and uniform scanning methods are used to find the fundamental frequency and eliminate power frequency harmonic noise. Finally, the parameters are accurately estimated to improve the accuracy of the signal.

<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
We have developed a thermal radiation experimental instrument that can eliminate the influence of thermal convection by making the thermal convection during the heat transfer process controllable. Using this instrument, we have studied the effects of factors such as object material, color, distance, and roughness on thermal radiation, and quantitatively obtained the absorption capacity of different materials for radiation through the calculation of blackness.
